# Lastword

A Letter-based social media web app. Inspired by Book: The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh.

# Description

This is my personal project for learning web technologies started in mid 2021. Build using MERN (React 17.xx create-react-app), Styled-Components, react-router-dom v6, redux-toolkit, etc. In the future maybe I will migrate this project using Typescript and Next.js.
I'm planning to keep maintaining and updating this project, because I know this is not a clean code. I'm open to any suggestion.
